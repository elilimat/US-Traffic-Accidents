# U.S. Traffic Accidents Project

## Overview
This project explores traffic accident data from across the United States.  
The goal is to identify key patterns, trends, and factors that affect accident rates.  
By studying when and where accidents happen most, and what conditions make them worse,  
we can find insights to help improve road safety.

## Objectives
- Analyze accident data to find trends by time, location, and weather.  
- Identify environmental and infrastructure factors that increase accident risk.  
- Provide three data-driven insights that can support safety improvement efforts.  
- Build clear, easy-to-understand visualizations and a Tableau dashboard.  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels)  
- Tableau for the final dashboard  
- Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and analysis  
- GitHub for version control and portfolio showcase  

## Dataset
The project uses the U.S. Accidents Dataset, which contains information about  
traffic accidents across the United States, including details like date, time,  
location, weather, visibility, and road conditions.  

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and analyzed dataset in Jupyter Notebook  
- Tableau dashboard showing three key insights  
- Video presentation and written reflection for project showcase  

## Key Learning Goals
- Practice data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Create effective visualizations that tell a story  
- Turn technical results into clear business insights
